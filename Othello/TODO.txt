- Expert & Ultimate just use BoardScore for Opponent
	- maybe Advanced & they can use Intermediate Scoring to do better
	- can they use Advanced for Opponent instead of just BoardScore?
	- can Unbeatble do true minMax of all paths for both Computer & Opponent?

- Skipping Turn still triggers FlipTimer, and it's confusing

- should ComputerVsComputer Tests compare total Pieces instead of Wins

- submenus under Level to choose Black or White
- UNDOS: previousState can be a stack

- show Legal Moves can show number of pieces flipped by Move
