- Ultimate Level
	should recurse for all Computer choices and return final Score, but should only recurse for Opponent's best Score because we don't want to choose based on Opponent making a bad Choice
	- AdvVsExp broke

- new Weighted Scores
	- Expert/Ultimate changed answers in TestLevels_Adv & _Exp

- Skipping Turn still triggers FlipTimer, and it's confusing

- should ComputerVsComputer Tests compare total Pieces instead of Wins

- submenus under Level to choose Black or White
- UNDOS: previousState can be a stack

- show Legal Moves can show number of pieces flipped by Move
